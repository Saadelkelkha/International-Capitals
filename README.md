# International-Capitals
The International Capitals project is a simple and interactive web page that allows users to input the names of countries and their capitals, which are then added to a table. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the DOM and display user inputs in a structured format.
